  <p> Hello,
      My name is Andrew Zaki, I am a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering student at New Jersey Institute of Technology.
  </p>
  <p> 
    I have participated in a term project called project innovation where I was responsible for reverse engineering a fishing 
  reel and making a functioning CAD model of it in Pro Engineering Parametric.
  In addition to reverse engineering the fishing reel, I had to reduce the number of steps to the creation of ketchup cups.

  <p>
    I was also captain of the East Brunswick Vex Robotics team that went to the world Competition in Florida.  
    While at NJIT I have also gained a firm understanding as to the strength of materials as well as the chemical makeup. 
    Through the labs I was able to see the concepts being explained in class be demonstrated in the lab. 
    I learned to rise to a leadership role due to the Vex Robotics team. I gained hands on experience in the labs in calculating certain components. 
</p>
<p>
I am fluent using most Microsoft Products i.e. Word, excel, PowerPoint.
I am able to program in matlab and am in the process of learning C coding. 
I am able to CAD using most engineering software including, Autocad 2015, Autodesk, Pro Engineering Wildfire and Parametric, and Solidworkds
